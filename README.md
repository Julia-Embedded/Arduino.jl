At the moment, this is a set of basic functions to communicate with the Arduino
(http://www.arduino.cc). It should probably cover 98% of use cases. It uses the
Arduino-serial library made by Tod E. Kurt
(http://todbot.com/blog/2006/12/06/arduino-serial-c-code-to-talk-to-arduino) and the
GetC macro of Jasper den Ouden (https://github.com/o-jasper).

A simple example is included.

#Usage notes

Compile the C file in the 'src' directory according to the instructions in the
file.

#Credit

Thanks to the Julia team (http://julialang.org) for making Julia, a programming
language that many have been longing for, whether they knew about it or not.
The "Octave-for-C-programmers," as I like to think of it, is an incredibly fast
and powerful programming language that is a welcome breath of fresh air in the
technical and numerical programming communities.
